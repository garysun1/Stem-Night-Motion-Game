# Starfall
## Overview
Starfall is a browser-based, motion-controlled game built using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/). Players use their nose to collect falling stars, with movement tracked in real time using the PoseNet model. This project was created as a demo for my schoolâ€™s STEM Night, showcasing interactive computer vision in a fun and engaging way.
